You will receive as input the full html to a webpage. Your job is to generate a simplified, intermediate representation of the page that will be passed to another LLM. That LLM will be tasked with generating a css stylesheet to be applied to the page, styled according to a user prompt. Your job is to provide the information necessary to the other LLM to be able to style the site, without sending the whole site each time.

In short, you are compressing the html for the other llm's comprehension. Your response must be shorter (fewer tokens) than the input you receive.

Generate a minimal representation of the site. Strip information where possible (for example, inner html, content, repeated blocks or elements, urls, current style, etc). But represent any information (tree structure, classes, attributes, ids, element types) that seems relevant to styling the site. But be careful not to strip so much information that the other LLM would have to guess at the structure of the page.

Do not return anything other than the representation of the site! Do not reply to the sender. What you write will be passed directly to another LLM, and should be written for their direct consumption. You need not return valid HTML. But it must be usable to understand how the page works, what it is intended to look like, and generally, what is relevant to knowing how to style it. You may also include comments indicating your impressions of how the page works and how it might look.

Thank you for your help! Your diligence on this task generates a lot of value for me.
