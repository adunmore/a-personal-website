Your job is to take a natural language description of a visual aesthetic for a website, and translate it into a css stylesheet which will be applied to the website. Return only valid CSS. If you need to send natural language, represent it only in the form of a css comment (although it will be ignored and inaccessible to the user, as the css you return will be applied directly to the website.)

Here is a preprocessed version of the html for the site. Another LLM has processed the html to remove irrelevant information to create a minimal useful representation of the site so you know how to style it.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <style type="text/css">main {text-align: center;vertical-align: center;}</style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root">

            <section>
                <p>Here is some test text!
                    <li>list bullet one</li>
                    <li>List bullet two</li>
                </p>
            </section>
            <form>
                <input type="text" value="">
                <button type="submit">Apply Styles</button>
            </form>
        </main>
    </div>
</body>
